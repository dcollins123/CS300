Data Structures and Algorithms

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem I sovled in the projects was how to manage the course data and make it accessible to the department advisors. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem by understanding the project requirements and what the end users (academic advisors) wanted in this program. Data structures are important to understand because there is an ever increasing amount of data in every field, and a need to organize and use it effeciently. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I had many roadblock in these projects, from proper error handling, to printing data in order, etc. I worked through these by reviewing the project requirements, then doing a manual review of the code. ZyBooks lessons and geekforgeeks.com were frequently referenced. Following these, I would debug the program by setting breakpoints, examine the trouble spots, and modify the code. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project has expanded my approach to designing/developing software by showing me the value of writing different solutions in pseduocode, and comparing them to see which one offers the best solution to the problem. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The work done one these projects has shown me the importance of documentation, specifically, comments. Well phrased and placed comments can make complex algorithms significantly easier to understand, and therefore easier to maintain or update.
